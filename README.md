# Top Spotify Songs in 73 Countries

## Data Engineering Zoomcamp  Project
This is my final project for the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp from DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) .

This zoomcamp had the following modules: 
  - Module 1: Containerization and Infrastructure as Code using Docker, Postgres, GCP and Terraform.
  - Module 2: Workflow Orchestration with Mage.
  - Module 3: Data Warehouse with BigQuery.
  - Module 4: Analytics engineering with dbt.
  - Module 5: Batch processing with Spark.
  - Module 6: Streaming with Kafka.
    
For my project I decided to analyze the top Spotify songs currently trending in the world. I wanted to discover which are the artists most listened to in a specific country and check if the level of the songs danceability, explicitness and instrumentalness have a relation with the popularity of the song. 
I choose this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/top-spotify-songs-in-73-countries-daily-updated)  from Kaggle that presents the top songs currently trending for over 70 countries which is updated daily.
