# Top Spotify Songs in 73 Countries

## Data Engineering Zoomcamp  Project
This is my final project for the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp from DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) .

This zoomcamp had the following modules: 
  - Module 1: Containerization and Infrastructure as Code using Docker, Postgres, GCP and Terraform.
  - Module 2: Workflow Orchestration with Mage.
  - Module 3: Data Warehouse with BigQuery.
  - Module 4: Analytics engineering with dbt.
  - Module 5: Batch processing with Spark.
  - Module 6: Streaming with Kafka.
    
For my project i decided to analyze the top Spotify songs currently trending in the world. I wanted to discover which are the artists most listened to in a specific country and check if the level of the songs danceability, explicitness and instrumentalness have a relation with the popularity of the song.
